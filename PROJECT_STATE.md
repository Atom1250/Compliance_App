## Tooling Notes
- Test command: `make test` (`.venv/bin/python -m pytest`)
- Lint command: `make lint` (`.venv/bin/python -m ruff check src apps tests`)
- Format command: no dedicated formatter target (ruff-only lint gate currently)
- Typecheck command: none configured
- Migration tooling: Alembic (`alembic.ini`, `alembic/versions/`, `alembic upgrade head`)
- Baseline PR-001 test run: `make test` -> `107 passed, 1 warning`

## Open Risks / Unknowns
- [ ] Confirm migrations framework and how to run upgrade/downgrade in CI.
- [ ] Confirm existing auth pattern for admin endpoints (or decide CLI-only for PR-011).
- [ ] Confirm where feature flags/config lives and naming conventions.
- [ ] Confirm test DB strategy for expanded Postgres smoke and parity gates (env-provided URL vs compose service in CI).
- [ ] `pytest` warns on unknown config key `asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope`; cleanup needed to avoid config drift.

## Repository Conventions
- Branch naming: `pr-XXX-<short-name>`
- Commit message: `PR-XXX: <short summary>`
