# PR-047 — F7: SQLite to Postgres Migration Tooling

## Checklist
- [x] Added deterministic migration utility for core workflow tables from SQLite to Postgres.
- [x] Added migration report output with per-table count/hash verification and insert/update stats.
- [x] Added CLI script entrypoint for migration execution.
- [x] Added idempotency unit test coverage.

## Commands Run
- `make lint` -> pass
- `make test` -> pass (`203 passed, 2 skipped`)

## Notes
- Utility is deterministic: source rows are migrated in stable PK order and verified using canonical row hashes.
- Re-running migration with identical source data produces zero inserts/updates.
