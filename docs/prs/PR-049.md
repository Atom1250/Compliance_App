# PR-049 — F9: Postgres SoR Runtime Cutover

## Checklist
- [x] Enforced runtime policy: SQLite is rejected outside test mode unless explicit transitional override is enabled.
- [x] Added config flags for runtime environment and transitional SQLite override.
- [x] Added focused runtime enforcement tests for reject/allow scenarios.
- [x] Added test-suite guardrails to keep existing SQLite fixture tests explicit in test mode.

## Commands Run
- `make lint` -> pass
- `make test` -> pass (`207 passed, 3 skipped`)

## Notes
- New settings:
  - `COMPLIANCE_APP_RUNTIME_ENVIRONMENT` (default: `development`)
  - `COMPLIANCE_APP_ALLOW_SQLITE_TRANSITIONAL` (default: `false`)
- Non-test runtime now enforces Postgres by default.
