# PR-046 — F6: Postgres End-to-End Harness

## Checklist
- [x] Added Postgres-mode deterministic E2E harness for company -> upload -> run -> report/evidence.
- [x] Added Postgres-gated test that provisions an isolated temporary database and validates readiness/export contracts.
- [x] Added script entrypoint for CLI execution of Postgres E2E harness.

## Commands Run
- `make lint` -> pass
- `make test` -> pass (`202 passed, 2 skipped`)

## Notes
- Postgres E2E test is gated by `COMPLIANCE_APP_POSTGRES_TEST_URL`.
- Harness uses deterministic fallback LLM provider to avoid external dependency flakiness.
