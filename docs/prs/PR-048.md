# PR-048 — F8: Dual-Backend Determinism Parity Checks

## Checklist
- [x] Added backend parity normalization and comparison helpers.
- [x] Added non-gated regression test validating normalization strategy for non-deterministic fields.
- [x] Added Postgres-gated parity test comparing SQLite UAT and Postgres E2E artifact contracts.
- [x] Extended Postgres E2E summary to include retrieval policy metadata for parity checks.

## Commands Run
- `make lint` -> pass
- `make test` -> pass (`204 passed, 3 skipped`)

## Notes
- Parity contract compares manifest, export readiness, report/evidence API status codes, and evidence metadata.
- `run_id` and other transient values are excluded from parity checks by design.
