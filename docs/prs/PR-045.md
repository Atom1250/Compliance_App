# PR-045 — F5: pgvector Embedding Schema Activation

## Checklist
- [x] Added migration for Postgres pgvector-backed embedding column.
- [x] Updated retrieval to prefer vector column payload when present.
- [x] Added retrieval stability test for vector-backed payload behavior.
- [x] Updated migration tests for new embedding vector column.

## Commands Run
- `make lint` -> pass
- `make test` -> pass (`202 passed, 1 skipped`)

## Notes
- Postgres path uses `embedding.embedding_vector` as `vector` type.
- SQLite transitional path uses nullable text fallback for compatibility.
